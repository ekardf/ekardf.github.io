Just read an article in the ACM Transactions on 

## Machine Learning

* Prediction model
* Black box
  - Deep learning
* Data driven
* Big data sets

## Social Science

* Explanation
* Hypothesis driven
  - Bayesian modelling
  - Prior belief
* Smaller data sets

## Conclusion

Computational social science needs to apply machine learning in a different way.
Transparency is needed, error analysis is needed and to model uncertainty.
