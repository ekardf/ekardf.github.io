title: Hedging in Scientific Literature
---

Scientist like to weaken assessments and avoid clear statements, usually called hedging.
Hedges are an important part of scientific communication, also as means to cater for the reader and leave room for interpretation in the reader's hands.

It is assumed that hedging words occur about as frequently as every 50th word.
Most common are verbs (would, may, indicates, ...), followed by adverbials (possibly, likely, ...).
In addition, phrases like "one cannot rule out" are common ways as well.

The IMRaD section with the highest frequency of heding is the discussion section, with the methods section being the least frequent one.
