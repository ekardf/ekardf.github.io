## Advancing climate science with Knowledge-Discovery through Data mining

Paper stating to use KDD for a deeper undertstanding of climate change. 
Just skimmed over the paper, it appears as if they use spatio-temporal data (i.e., measurements of sea temperatures a geo-positions over time) and apply clustering.
The results seems to be conitnuous regions of similar behaviour.
As pre-processing they transfor the geo-positions to nodes in a graph.

The software, delta-MAPS, is available at github, but only as a ZIP file.
